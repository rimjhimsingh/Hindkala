# Hindkala

The aim of this project is to provide a platform for exhibiting and selling the indigenous art forms of the
country. We are developing a web application, to build a bridge between the indigenous artists and the
international market, thereby providing global recognition to their products. The user would be able to
order the products and support these artists from the comfort of their homes. This project is also a small
step to promote the ‘Make in India’ initiative taken by the Government of India.
The web application aims to connect both artists and cultural organizations to the market
thus completing the demand-supply chain. The artforms which are dying due to lack of visibility will
finally have a platform to gain recognition and financial flow. To avoid the exploitation of artists, we
provide direct transaction options and eliminate middlemen from the process.

1. Inquire about various indigenous products
2. Register and Login to the portal
3. A cart to store all the selected products and review the order
4. Order products and pay for them online
5. Leave comments and reviews for the products
6. Sort and view the products according to different states and tags
7. Get access to authentic information about different art forms of india via HindKala’s blog
